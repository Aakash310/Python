###### Using Pillow Library in Python

Python Imaging Library (abbreviated as PIL) (in newer versions known as Pillow) is a free and open-source additional library for the Python programming language 
that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. It is available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

The Image is much larger than we need it to be!.
So we can use some python code to resize the image and save it under a new name in the same directory.
